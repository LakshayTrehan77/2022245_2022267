We have provided UML diagram containing both the class and user case diagram and 4 scenes containing the intro video, main menu, start game scene and game over scene.
We have also added background music and screenshots of the scenes as well as their fxml file ( UI scripts ). 
Note: If you are unable to load any image or video adjust the paths according to your system. 
Run the stickherogame class to get a sample UI of the entire project.
If you can not view the fxml file properly run the stickherogame class.

We have added game level as an additional bonus feature.

we have created several classes and have established relationship amongst them as provided in the UML diagram
