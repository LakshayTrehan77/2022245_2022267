--- We have provided UML diagram containing both the class and user case diagram and 4 scenes containing the intro video, main menu, start game scene and game over scene.
We have also added background music and screenshots of the scenes as well as their fxml file ( UI scripts ). 

--- Note: If you are unable to load any image or video adjust the paths according to your system. 
Run the stickherogame class to get a sample UI of the entire project.
If you can not view the fxml file properly run the stickherogame class.

--- We have added game level as an additional bonus feature.

--- We have created several classes and have established relationship amongst them as provided in the UML diagrams and have used all the concepts of oops for the same.
--- We have added the JUnit class and the test sameple test methods
--- We have additional feature of Level where the difficulty increases by increase in levels
--- We will use Multithreading in the Game Operations performed by the StickHeroGame 


FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION
--- Our code runs from the class StikHeroGame.
--- We have implemented 2 design patterns one singleton design pattern in cherry class and another Stratergy design pattern in GameCharacter class and StickHero class as we are using Gamecharacter abstract class in StickHero class and implementing the abstract method move, another place where we have mplemented stratergy design pattern is in abstract class StickHeroGameException which is use by StickHeroCollisionException and StickHeroReviveException to make the code optimal and efficient.
--- We have used JUnit to test the cases
--- We have also added BONUS feature of leveling up the game and have also used Multithreading in Scene3 by using executor service and by extending thread class.
